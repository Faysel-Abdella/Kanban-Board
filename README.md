# Kanban-Board
Hi, this is my second project at 'Al-bunyan al-marsus' programming contest. The task was to build a project managment kanban board that to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow).

The following core concepts javaScript is used
1. Array of object
2. High order array methods
3. Dealing with local storage
4. Drag and drop functionality for all tasks
 
 All new tasks that the the user creates are stored in localstorage with the name of the task (if the user gives a name ).
 The user also can transfer a task from one type(column) to another easily by drag and drop.
